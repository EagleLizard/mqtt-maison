# MQTT Maison

This is a project to replace some MQTT-based Node-RED automations which required custom scripts to glue different workflow steps together.

I think it will be more clear to write the automations as scripts directly.

Follows experiments in https://github.com/EagleLizard/julius-ezd-2025
